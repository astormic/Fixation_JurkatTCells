## Materials:
- PFA (Paraformaldehyde)

- GA (Glutaraldehyde)

- PBS (Phosphate-buffered saline)

## Methods:
### Prepare 1x PBS
1. Dissolve 1 PBS tablet by 50 ml DI water in a50 ml plastic tube to make 2x PBS.
2. Pipette 25 ml of 2x PBS into another 50 ml plastic tube.
3. Pipette 25 ml DI water into both plastic tubes to make 1x PBS.
4. Filter the PBS solution using 50 ml plastic syringe and 0.22 um nylon filter.

### Fixation
1. Put a beaker containing more than 10mL water into a fume cupboard (for washing the ampules later).
2. Dilute 16% PFA into 1% using PBS: pipette 15mL PBS into a plastic tube using 10mL pipette, stand it safely using a plastic holder, put on thick nitrile gloves, pipette 1mL PFA into the same tube inside the fume cupboard. Put ampule with left-over PFA into a waste bottle. 
3. Dilute 70% GA into 2% using PBS: pipette 8.5 mL PBS into a plastic tube using 10ml pipette, stand it safely using a plastic holder, put on thick nitrile gloves, pipette 250 uL GA into the same tube inside the fume cupboard. Put ampule with left-over GA into a waste bottle.
4. Label the cells using primary antibody (see .....)
5. Mixing 1mL 1% PFA with 0.1 mL 2% GA with centrifuged cells in PBS, put the mixture in fridge.
6. Wait for 30 minutes, wash PFA and GA away using PBS. Pipette wastewater into halogenated waste container.
7. Keep diluted PFA and GA in fridge for up to a week, then dispose them into halogenated waste container. Rinse the container plastic tubes 3 times using water and pour the wastewater into halogenated waste
container.
8. This process will be repeated every week typically for about 1-4 weeks as required for subsequent cell analysis. Waste bottles wil be sent to disposal every 3 months.
 
## FAQs: 
**Why do we mix PFA with GA?**

The glutaraldehyde is necessary to stop all molecules, PFA only stops 95% or so according to [this paper](https://journals.biologists.com/bio/article/5/9/1343/1227/Critical-importance-of-appropriate-fixation).

## Hazards identified:

### PFA:
Harmful in contact with skin or if inhaled; Causes skin irritation.
May cause an allergic skin reaction;
Causes serious eye irritation; May cause respiratory irritation;
Suspected of causing genetic defects; May cause cancer.

### GA:
Harmful fi swallowed or fi inhaled;
Causes severe skin burns and eye damage.
May cause an allergic skin reaction;
May cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled; Very toxic ot aquatic life;
Toxic ot aquatic life with long lasting effects.

### PBS:
Eye: May cause eye irritation.
Skin: May cause skin irritation.
Ingestion: May cause irritation of the digestive tract. Low hazard for usual industrial handling.
